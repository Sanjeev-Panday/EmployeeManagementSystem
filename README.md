# Employee Management System 🚀

Welcome to the **Employee Management System** project! This is not your ordinary project—it's a fun, hands-on way to master Java  **Streams** and **Functional Interfaces** with real-world-inspired challenges. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to level up your functional programming skills or someone curious about the power of Java streams, you're in the right place! 💻

## 🔥 Project Overview

The **Employee Management System** is a mock organizational system where you'll interact with a dataset of employees, departments, and projects. This project is designed to help you practice Java 8 features, specifically **Streams**, **Lambdas**, **Functional Interfaces**, and **Lombok**.

Here’s a sneak peek of what you'll be working with:
- Employees with attributes like `name`, `age`, `department`, `salary`, and the projects they're working on.
- A system that simulates real-world data processing tasks.
- **Lombok** annotations to reduce boilerplate code, letting you focus on business logic and functional programming.

## 🏆 The Challenges

Below is a series of fun challenges (tasks) that you can complete to master Java 8 Streams and Functional Interfaces. Each task will help you explore a new aspect of the Java Streams API. Treat this as a game: solve each task, and you'll be one step closer to becoming a Java 8 master!

### 1. Filter and Collect

*Challenge:* Find all employees older than 40 and collect their names into a list.

💡 *Hint:* Use `filter()` and `map()` operations.

### 2. Mapping and Collecting

*Challenge:* Create a list of all unique department names where employees work.

💡 *Hint:* Use `map()` and `distinct()`.

### 3. FlatMapping

*Challenge:* List all unique project names that employees are working on.

💡 *Hint:* Use `flatMap()` to flatten the project lists and `map()` to extract the project names.

### 4. Grouping

*Challenge:* Group employees by their departments.

💡 *Hint:* Use `Collectors.groupingBy()`.

### 5. Partitioning

*Challenge:* Partition employees into two groups based on whether they earn more than $80,000.

💡 *Hint:* Use `Collectors.partitioningBy()`.

### 6. Reducing

*Challenge:* Calculate the total salary expenditure of the company.

💡 *Hint:* Use `mapToDouble()` and `sum()` or `reduce()`.

### 7. Custom Collector

*Challenge:* Implement a custom collector to concatenate all employee names, separated by commas.

💡 *Hint:* Use `Collector.of()` to create a custom collector.

### 8. Parallel Streams

*Challenge:* Use parallel streams to process employees and find the maximum salary.

💡 *Hint:* Use `parallelStream()` and `max()`.

### 9. Functional Interfaces

*Challenge:* Create a custom `FunctionalInterface` named `EmployeePredicate` that tests an `Employee` object based on some criteria (e.g., age > 30 and department is DEVELOPMENT). Use it to filter employees.

💡 *Hint:* Define an interface with a method `boolean test(Employee e)`.

### 10. Optional Usage

*Challenge:* Safely handle retrieval of an employee who may or may not exist in the list (e.g., find an employee named "Zoe").

💡 *Hint:* Use `findFirst()` and wrap the result in an `Optional`.

### 11. Statistics with Collectors

*Challenge:* Compute statistical data such as average age, total salary, and count of employees.

💡 *Hint:* Use `Collectors.summarizingDouble()` and `Collectors.averagingInt()`.

### 12. Chaining Stream Operations

*Challenge:* Find the names of clients whose projects are handled by employees in the SALES department.

💡 *Hint:* Combine `filter()`, `flatMap()`, and `map()`.

### 13. Exception Handling in Streams

*Challenge:* Handle potential exceptions when accessing project budgets (e.g., if a project budget is negative, throw an exception).

💡 *Hint:* Use `peek()` for debugging and handle exceptions within lambda expressions.

### 14. Function Composition

*Challenge:* Compose two functions: one that takes an `Employee` and returns their name, and another that takes a name and returns it in uppercase. Apply the composed function to all employees.

💡 *Hint:* Use `Function.andThen()` or `Function.compose()`.

### 15. Sorting with Custom Comparator

*Challenge:* Sort the list of employees first by department, then by salary in descending order.

💡 *Hint:* Use `Comparator.comparing()` with `thenComparing()`.
